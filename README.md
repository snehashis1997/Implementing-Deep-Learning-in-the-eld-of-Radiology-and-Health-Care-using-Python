# Implementing-Deep-Learning-in-the-field-of-Radiology-and-Health-Care-using-Python
In my internship at “RAD365” (https://www.rad365.com/), I was design various classiﬁcation and segmentation CNN models using Python Keras, Opencv, Sklearn etc. libraries. Here I implement CNN models for CT, MRI, X-RAY images.

# libraries used in this project:
1. Numpy -- for matrix and array related operations
2. Matplotlib -- for plotting
3. Scikit image - for image read write,specificly I used it for .nii image read
4. pydicom -- for dicom image array read
5. Opencv -- for image processings opperation like blurring,thresholding etc etc.
6. Keras -- for Deep learning architecture building

# Work

1. The first project is a multiclass classification problem, where I develop a Transfer learning based CNN model for four classes (1 for meningioma, 2 for glioma, 3 for pituitary    tumour 4 for Normal).

   --- The final testing accuracy is 87%.
   
2. The second project is a binary segmentation problem, where I develop an Encoder-Decoder based CNN model for segmentation.

3. The third project is a multiclass segmentation problem, where I develop an Encoder-Decoder based CNN model for segmenting spinal cord from MRI image.

4. The fourth project is a segmentation problem, where I develop an Encoder-Decoder based CNN model for four classes (1 for meningioma, 2 for glioma, 3 for pituitary tumour 4 for    Normal) segmentation.
