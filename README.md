# Implementing-Deep-Learning-in-the-eld-of-Radiology-and-Health-Care-using-Python
In my internship at “RAD365 Technologies Inc”, I was design various classiﬁcation and segmentation CNN models using Python Keras, Opencv, Sklearn etc. libraries. Here I implement CNN models for CT, MRI, X-RAY images.

# libraries used in this project:
1. Numpy -- for matrix and array related operations
2. Matplotlib -- for plotting
3. Scikit image - for image read write,specificly I used it for .nii image read
4. pydicom -- for dicom image array read
5. Opencv -- for image processings opperation like blurring,thresholding etc etc.
